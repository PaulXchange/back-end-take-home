# Regov Technologies Sdn Bhd Take Home Challenge (Full Stack Developers)

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

This take home test is used to determine how you go about solving problems logically, as well as building out easy to use, performant user interfaces. This test is very open to interpretation and implementation.

### Coding Challenge

Build a simple user management portal with registration process. The registration process require three steps.

1. Collect user credentials
2. A placeholder to upload international passport or national identity card. Then the placeholder should display the upload.
3. A final preview of all inputs (credentials and upload) before submission.

While previewing a user will be able to update the inputs and re-upload a new image.

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can preview my inputs and edit on the same page before submitting my registration.
